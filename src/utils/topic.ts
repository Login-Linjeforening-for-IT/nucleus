/**
 * This is a complex file, therefore a queue system has been implemented.
 * We allow the first request, then store the most recent request at all times
 * while the first one is working. For example if we have 10 requests, number 1
 * will execute, and 2 will be stored, then when 3 comes in, 3 will override 2,
 * which continues until we are left with request 1 and 10. When number 1 is 
 * done, number 10 will run. If this keeps going, the loop will be infinite 
 * until the requests stop.
 * 
 * When a request comes in, it first sets up throttling so all other requests
 * are stored or dropped if they are not the last one nor unique. Then we check
 * if the request is for a language change or a notification state change. These
 * are handled differently, and therefore have different queues.
 * 
 * Language changes require all currently subscribed topics to be converted to
 * the new language, except events (might be implemented in the future). The
 * topics for the previous language will be unsubscribed, as the new ones are
 * added. When everything has completed, the function will execute again if
 * there is another language request in the queue.
 * 
 * Notification state requests will check all notification states, not just
 * itself, due to the nature of the state being an array, and Redux update
 * limits. This is the type where throttling is the most important, as you can
 * see how hundreds of request can quickly accumulate as one button click equals
 * about 60 requests. However with throttling, you will only get a few requests
 * per second, even when the user is subscribing in complex patterns in a fast
 * manner. After executing successfully, the function will check if there are
 * more notification state requests that have not been processed yet, and if so
 * execute the last one.
